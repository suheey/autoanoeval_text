    "normal_relationships": "Baseline heart rate (LB) clusters around 130–135 bpm and matches Mode and Mean; accelerations (AC) are usually 2–7 per 2 s window; short-term variability is moderate (ASTV 16–28 %, MSTV 1.4–2.4 bpm); abnormal long-term variability (ALTV) equals 0 and severe decelerations (DS) are absent; beat-to-beat Variance is ≥7 and histogram Width is typically ≥66 bpm.
