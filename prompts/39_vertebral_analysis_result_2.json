    "normal_relationships": "Pelvic incidence approximately equals pelvic tilt plus sacral slope (difference usually <10°). Incidence ranges 36–70°, tilt 5–25°, sacral slope 26–46°, and lumbar lordosis angle correlates with incidence (25–50°). Pelvic radius lies 84–130 mm. Degree spondylolisthesis typically stays between −11 % and +13 %.",

    "condition": "abs(pelvic incidence - (pelvic tilt + sacral slope)) > 10",
    "explanation": "Large mismatch between pelvic incidence and the sum of tilt and slope violates the anatomical constraint, indicating measurement error or severe pelvic imbalance.",
    "scenario": "Imaging artifact or structural deformity causing inconsistent angular metrics."

    "condition": "degree spondylolisthesis > 20 AND pelvic incidence < 40",
