    "normal_relationships": "Pelvic incidence closely equals the sum of pelvic tilt and sacral slope (incidence ≈ tilt + slope). Pelvic incidence typically ranges 40–70°, pelvic tilt 5–25°, sacral slope 25–45°, and lumbar lordosis angle aligns moderately (25–50°). Pelvic radius stays between 90–130 mm, and degree spondylolisthesis remains near zero (≈ −10 to +15%).",

    {
    "condition": "abs(pelvic incidence - (pelvic tilt + sacral slope)) > 10",
    "explanation": "A large mismatch between pelvic incidence and the sum of tilt and slope violates the anatomical relationship, suggesting severe pelvic imbalance or measurement error.",
    "scenario": "Imaging artifact or structural deformity causing inconsistent angular metrics."

    {
    "condition": "degree spondylolisthesis > 20 AND pelvic incidence > 70",
    "explanation": "High slip percentage combined with very large pelvic incidence indicates advanced spondylolisthesis with compensatory pelvic retroversion.",
    "scenario": "Progressive vertebral slippage in high-grade spondylolisthesis."

    {
    "condition": "pelvic radius < 80 AND lumbar lordosis angle > 50",
    "explanation": "An unusually small pelvic radius paired with excessive lordosis suggests hyperlordotic curvature and possible congenital malformation.",

    {
    "condition": "pelvic tilt > 30 AND sacral slope < 20",
    "explanation": "Excessive posterior pelvic tilt while the sacrum remains relatively horizontal reflects sagittal imbalance.",

    "condition": "pelvic incidence < 35 AND lumbar lordosis angle > 45",
    "explanation": "Low anatomical incidence cannot normally support a deep lumbar curve, indicating pathological lordosis.",
