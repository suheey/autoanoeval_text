Based on these 10 normal examples, explain step-by-step what would constitute realistic anomaly patterns:

1️⃣ Identify typical feature relationships
Normally, [describe typical relationships between features based on the examples above]

2️⃣ Derive anomaly conditions 1
If [condition], this might be due to [reason].

3️⃣ Derive anomaly conditions 2
Similarly, [another condition] may suggest [another reason].

Then provide mathematical conditions for anomalies:

📌 Anomaly Condition Examples (always combine **at least two** different features):
• [Feature_A] > [threshold_A] AND [Feature_B] < [threshold_B] → 🔍 [explanation]
• [Feature_C] > [threshold_C] AND [Feature_D] / [Feature_E] > [ratio] → 🔍 [explanation]
• [Feature_F] = [value_F] AND [Feature_G] < [threshold_G] AND [Feature_H] > [threshold_H] → 🔍 [explanation]

📌 Provide 5 anomaly conditions in JSON format, each with a `condition`, `explanation`, and `scenario`:

    "anomaly_conditions": [
        {

            "explanation": "reason why this combination is anomalous",
            "scenario": "real-world scenario that could cause this anomaly"
