    "condition": "AC > 6 AND FM > 20",

    "condition": "ASTV < 10 AND MSTV > 5",
    "explanation": "Very low short-term variability combined with an unusually high mean short-term variability suggests inconsistent heart-rate modulation, implying possible cardiac issues.",
    "scenario": "Underlying fetal cardiac irregularities create contradictory variability metrics."

    "condition": "ALTV > 10 AND MLTV > 30",
    "explanation": "Elevated long-term variability values point to abnormal, large-scale fluctuations in heart rate, often linked to fetal or maternal complications.",

    "explanation": "A very high count of histogram peaks together with many zero-count bins indicates an irregular heart-rate distribution.",
